# Creating Routes for Our Server

Now that we have our server running, we can create routes for our server. We will create a route for our server to handle requests to the root URL, and a route to handle requests to the `/aboutMe` URL.

By this point, your index.js file should look like this:

```javascript
// load the express library
const express = require("express"); 

// create an express application
const app = express(); 
const port = 8080; 
app.use(express.json()); 

// now we can start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port: ${port}`);
});
```

Now let's start off by just creating a route for the root URL. A route is a URL pattern that the server should listen for.

We can do this by using the `app.get` method. This method takes two arguments: the URL to match, and a callback function to run when a request is made to that URL. 

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("<h1>Welcome to my server!</h1>");
});
```

You may notice that the callback function takes two arguments: `req` and `res`. These stand for "request" and "response", respectively. The `req` object contains information about the request that was made, and the `res` object contains methods for sending a response back to the client. In this case, we are using the `res.send` method to send a simple HTML string back to the client.

Now if you try to visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser, you should see the message "Welcome to my server!". If you don't see this message, it might be because Node.js does not automatically restart the server when you make changes to your code. You can stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal, and then start it again by running `node index.js`.

Or, you can install a package called `nodemon` which will automatically restart the server when you make changes to your code. You can install `nodemon` by running `npm install nodemon`. Next, you have to add the following line to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

And you can type `npm start` in the terminal to start the server with `nodemon`.

Now you should see the message "Welcome to my server!" when you visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

Now let's create a route for the `/aboutMe` URL. This route is going to return a `JSON` object instead of an HTML string. We can do this by using the `res.json` method.

```javascript
app.get("/aboutMe", (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        name: "YOUR NAME",
        age: YOUR_AGE,
        hobbies: ["hobby1", "hobby2", "hobby3"]
    });
});
```

A `JSON` object is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a JavaScript object/Dictionary Data Structure. In this case, we are sending back an object with three keys: `name`, `age`, and `hobbies`. The `res.json` method will automatically convert this object to a `JSON` string and send it back to the client. A lot of the web applications you use every day send and receive `JSON` data. Why? Because it's a lightweight and easy-to-parse format that is easy to work with in JavaScript.

Now if you visit `http://localhost:8080/aboutMe` in your browser, you should see a `JSON` object with your name, age, and hobbies. You may notice that depending on your browser, the `JSON` object may be displayed in a more readable format. If you are using Google Chrome, you can install a browser extension called "JSONView" to make `JSON` objects more readable.

That is how you create routes for your server. You can create as many routes as you want, and you can use different HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to handle different types of requests. We will cover these other HTTP methods in the next lesson as well as dynamic routes and route parameters.
