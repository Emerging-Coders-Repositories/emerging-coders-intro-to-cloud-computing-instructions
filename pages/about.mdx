# About

This is a simple project that is meant to to be used a starting point to learn more about Cloud Computing. In this project, we will build a simple web server that will be deployed to the cloud. We will use the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/login)

The main goal of this tutorial is to expose you to the basics of setting up a web server and deploying it it the cloud. There are a series of challenges that you can complete to further your understanding of the technologies used in this tutorial. We hope that you find this tutorial useful and that you are able to learn something new and hopefully, use what you learn to begin building your own projects.

The information presented in this tutorial is taken from the presentation lead by the Emerging Coders Webmaster, [Ethan Pineda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanpineda/).
