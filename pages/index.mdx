# Introduction
 
Welcome to the **Introduction to Cloud Computing** tutorial! 


## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is how large companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or really, any technology company that has a large user base, store and process data. It is a way to store data and run programs on a remote server, rather than on your local machine. This is useful because it allows you to access your data from anywhere, and it allows you to run programs that require a lot of computing power. Because of the cloud computing, we're able to easily access our emails, photos, and connect with others in a faster, efficient, and safe way.

## Setting up For this Workshop
For this workshop, we will assume that you already are comfortable with programming with an IDE such as Visual Studio code. You can use any other editor that you are comfortable with, but we will be using Visual Studio Code for this workshop. If you want the easiest possible setup, you can use the following [Replit Repository](https://replit.com/@ethanpaneraa/StaleCrushingBash#index.js). If you prefer working locally, then here is what you need to have installed: 

### Installing npm
npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.

To install npm, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Installing Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

To install Node.js, you can follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
